ABOUT:
    - Heavily inspired by wiremod
    - Also has boolean logic capabilities
        - 0 = false
        - > 0 = true (any value 1 or more acts as true)
    - Wires carry data between two nodes


PLAN:
    - Create node system
    - Implement logic tick (Can be greater or less than FPS, IE Not tied)
    - Camera Controls
    - Data line types (color coded: number (float or int), string, array(?))
    - Implement components (Logic group, displays, etc)

HIERARCHY:
    - Circuit
        - Components
            - Nodes
                - Node Connectors
                    - Input
                    - Output
            - Wires
                - Origin Node Connector
                - Destination Node Connector
